**step 13 to 23**

13. Now that is done there is a few more configurations we will need to update, first open up the PHP config file by entering.

sudo nano /etc/php/7.0/fpm/php.ini

14. In this file, we want to find and update the following lines. (Ctrl + w allows you to search)

upload_max_filesize = 2000M
post_max_size = 2000M

15. Once done save and exit. Now we need to edit the conf file by entering the following:

	sudo nano /etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
16. Update the listen line to the following:

listen = 127.0.0.1:9000
17. Once done, save and then exit. Now we also need to edit the dphys-swapfile. To do this open up the file by entering:

sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
18. Now update the conf_swapsize line to the following:

CONF_SWAPSIZE = 512
19. Restart the Pi by entering:

sudo reboot
20. Once the Pi has restarted, you will need to install Owncloud onto the Raspberry Pi. Do this by entering the following commands:

sudo mkdir -p /var/www/owncloud
sudo wget https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-10.0.9.tar.bz2
sudo tar xvf owncloud-10.0.9.tar.bz2
sudo mv owncloud/ /var/www/
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
rm -rf owncloud owncloud-10.0.9.tar.bz2
21. Now we need to open up the .user.ini file to enforce some of the changes we made earlier in the tutorial

sudo nano /var/www/owncloud/.user.ini
22. In here update the following values so they are 2000M:

upload_max_filesize=2000M

post_max_size=2000M

memory_limit=2000M
23. Now that is done we should be able to connect to Owncloud at your PI’s IP address.

Before you set up the admin account, you might want to mount an external drive, so you have lots of disk space for your Raspberry Pi Owncloud Server. 


** Thats all for setting Raspberry pi **
**Next step is to mount harddisk to raspberry pi which accept data from external networks**
